🌿 AI-Based Medicinal Plant Identification System (Frontend)
📌 Project Overview

This project is part of a research system developed to help users identify Sri Lankan medicinal plants and check their visual health condition using Artificial Intelligence.

The system is mainly useful for:

Young people

Ayurvedic students

Farmers

General users

Many people do not have enough knowledge to identify medicinal plants correctly.
This system helps users identify plants, check plant health, and get general recommendations using a simple web interface.

🎯 Main Features

Upload medicinal plant images

Identify the medicinal plant using AI

Check plant health status (Healthy / Poor)

Display prediction results clearly

Get general recommendations to improve plant quality

Simple and user-friendly web interface

🧠 My Contribution (50% Progress)

My individual contribution focuses on:

Training a CNN model using transfer learning

Integrating the trained model with a Flask backend

Connecting the backend with the frontend

Enabling real-time image upload and prediction

The system is fully working from frontend → backend → AI model → result.

🖼️ How the System Works

User opens the web application

User uploads an image of a medicinal plant

The image is sent to the Flask backend

The AI model processes the image

The system returns:

Plant name

Health status

General recommendations
